# Unity Framework for AR Sandboxes

This was an student project at the [TH Rosenheim](https://www.th-rosenheim.de/) in Wintersemester 2019/2020.
Credits for this Work go to [Christian Kink](https://github.com/WhatzzUp),Alexander Gebhardt, Johannes Nowack and [Patrick Stadler](https://github.com/patsta32)

This framework uses the [Intel Real Sense SDK 2](https://www.intel.de/content/www/de/de/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html) and should be compatible with all supporting Cameras. Currently only RealSense d415 was tested.


## Features
This Framework features:
* Dual Monitor Support (One for the Sandbox and One for Desktop use like 3D-Person)
* Dynamic path finding when terrain is changed
* QR Code detection inside the sandbox
* Easy to use terrain shading for real time performance
* Access to to the depth image as texture
